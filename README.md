# ChatSearchAI targets to enable AI powered search in chats

Currently the application in the repository supports only AI based image search which uses OpenAI's CLIP model to retrieve related images _underscores_.

The application can be further redeveloped using

*NLP methods such as "Question - Answering" models.
*Searching inside video and audio data
*Question answering based on images, etc.

Open to collaboration and pull requests.
