# ChatSearchAI targets to enable AI powered search in chats

Currently the application in the repository supports only AI based image search which uses OpenAI's CLIP model to retrieve related images.

The application can be further redeveloped using

+ NLP methods such as "Question - Answering" models.
+ Searching inside video and audio data
+ Question answering based on images, etc.

Open to collaboration and pull requests.
